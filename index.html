          <h2>Steve Jobs, Seymour Cray and thinking differently</h2>
      <BR>
          <div align="left"style="width: 698px">
          <p>If I asked everyone in a room of 500 random people if they knew who Steve Jobs was to raise their hand, I'm guessing every hand in the room would go up. If I were to ask who Seymour Cray was only a few might get raised.</p>
          
          <p>Seymour Cray is considered the grandfather of the modern supercomputer and his work helped to  revolutionize science and the world around us. Supercomputers are the extremely fast computers scientists are using to tackle gene sequencing, global warming, cures for cancer and other illnesses along with thousands of other complex problems we  as a species face.</p>
          
          <p>Being the computer geek Steve Jobs was as child, It's likely that Seymour was a childhood idol and we also know Apple Computer used a Cray Supercomputer to design components of the Apple Macintosh. As men, Steve Jobs and Seymour Cray shared much in common. They both had a strong appreciation for graphic and industrial design,  had a few social skill shortcomings and were the undisputed leaders of the computer industry for their generations. They also both believed in a philosophy of doing things differently.</p>
          
          <p>My favorite Apple campaign to date is the Think Different campaign which launched in 1996. What most people don't know is in a video interview a little over a year before its launch, Seymour Cray was recorded saying,</p>
<!--blockquote Semantic Tag #9-->
        <blockquote>
<!--italics Semantic Tag #10-->
          <p><i>"One of my guiding principles is don’t do anything that other people are doing. Always do something a little different if you can. The concept is that if you do it a little differently there is a greater potential for reward than if you the same thing that other people are doing. I think that this kind of goal for one’s work, having obviously the maximum risk, would have the maximum reward no matter what the field may be."</i></p>
        </blockquote>
          <p>Clearly both of these men lived by the belief that thinking outside the box and trying new things was the road to success. It's also a fact that while hugely successful both of them faced defeats in part because of this philosophy. However, both managed to pick themselves up, learn from those failures and find even greater success.</p>
          
          <p>Seymour Cray and his legacy have become an inspiration to me. Even though it's of no consequence, part of me would like to believe that it's more than coincidence that Apple's Think different campaign came out shortly after Cray's video interview. At the very least, if anyone's face deserved to be on a six foot tall subway poster with a Think different slogan underneath, that person was Seymour Cray.</p>
          
          <p>If he were alive to celebrate it, today would mark Seymour's 90th birthday. With that in mind I'd like to wish him a happy birthday and thank him for his contributions that have helped make our lives just a little bit better.</p>
